I'm not sure what to expect. I hope you don't expect things either...

# Python libraries

The current plan says we should try twisted. If this plan somewhat succeed,
this could end up in the master. There isn't much code yet to worry about.

Current used version of twisted: 12.1.0

# Installing

* The `easy_install` way: `easy_install twisted`
* The `pip` way: `pip install twisted`

(note: if you don't know, pick the `easy_install` method)
